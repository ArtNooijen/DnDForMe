# DnDForMe

# Introduction 

## Reasoning 
This portfolio serves as a way for me to show the progress I have made and as a guid to my project “DNDForMe”. After reading this document you will have good idea of my progress in semester 3 of Demand based ICT at Fontys Hogeschool. 


## Who am I? 
My name is Art Nooijen, a 23-year-old student. I am studying HBO-ICT Demand-based in the Netherlands. I am currently in semester 3 of my curriculum.    

## Content

This Document contains the information I will make for Semester 2: 
This is contained below: 

### 1. Web application
Learning outcome: You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications. 

I try to create a positive user experience. To this end I have created a few Storyboard [designs and implemented a colour pallet research](https://github.com/Artnooijen/DnDForMe/blob/main/Documentation/Colour%20Pallet%20and%20storyboard%20designs.pdf) for DNDForMe. At the same time, I implement the best practices I can. I do this by doing a [UX Research](https://github.com/Artnooijen/DnDForMe/blob/main/Documentation/UX%20Research.pdf) based on the DOT Framework. Combining these elements I hope to provide the user with a pleasant and easy experience on DNDForMe. 


For the frontend of my web application, I have chosen to use [VUE](). For backend I am using an Internal ASP.NET API with a five-layer architecture. Using interfaces, factories, logic and data-layer. Als of a python API to make calls to an external Dungeons and dragons API: Open5e 

//todo You design and build a full stack application using a commonly accepted front end Javascript framework and back end application implementing relevant communication protocols, persistence of data by usage of ORM and addressing asynchronous communication issues.


### 2. Software quality
Learning outcome: You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and 

//todo Tooling and methodology: Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.

### 3. Agile method
Learning outcome You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

One way of showing my knowledge and implementation of Agile is by making and presenting a workshop together with my fellow student. I have explained the Agile manifesto. I have done this in the way of giving [examples and the history of the Agile Manifesto.](https://github.com/Artnooijen/DnDForMe/blob/main/Documentation/Agile-Scrum%20workshop-%20Art%20Nooijen.pdf)) 

I also exercise Agile in my group project by working with scrum and being the scrum master of the group. We work in three weeklong sprints where we act try to implement as many Scrum values and principles as possible. We work with stand-ups and stand-downs. 

### 4. CI/CD
Learning outcome: You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context. 

### 5. Cultural differences and ethics
Learning outcome: You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

### 6. Requirements and design
Learning outcome: You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.

The requirements I have made are based on my focus group (teenager-senior Dungeon and Dragon players) They are ranked via the MoSCoW method. The user Storys have been ranked based on importance by the product owner(me). You can find my requirements [here](https://github.com/Artnooijen/DnDForMe/blob/main/Documentation/Requirement-UC.pdf). 

### 7. Business processes
Learning outcome: You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project. 

### 8. Professional
Learning outcome: You act in a professional manner during software development and learning. 

One way I have shown my professionalism is by making and presenting a workshop together with my fellow student. I have explained the Agile manifesto. I have done this in the way of giving [examples and the history of the Agile Manifesto.](https://github.com/Artnooijen/DnDForMe/blob/main/Documentation/Agile-Scrum%20workshop-%20Art%20Nooijen.pdf))
